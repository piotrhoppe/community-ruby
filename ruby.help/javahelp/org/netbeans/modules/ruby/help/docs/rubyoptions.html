<h2>Options Window: Ruby </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> 


<p>The Ruby options window enables you to set things like which Ruby interpreter is used by NetBeans, the debugger to use, the formatting of code in the editor, and how hints are displayed. The latter two options appear on the Formatting and Hints tabs and are well documented on those tabs. However, the Platform tab could use some explanation.
<h3>Platform Tab</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ruby Interpreter.</b> You can change the Ruby interpreter if you have your own installation of Ruby or Ruby on Rails. If you want to use an interpreter other than the default JRuby interpreter (for example, because you want to use the fast debugger), click the Browse button  and navigate to the Ruby interpreter file in your Ruby or Rails installation (for example, usually ruby.exe in a Windows installation), and then click the Open button.</li>
  <li><b>Ruby Debugger.</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Classic Debugger.</b> The default debugger, which works with all interpreters. </li>
      <li> <b>Fast Debugger.</b> Available only if you use the C Ruby interpreter (also known as native Ruby and MRI). This debugger is a gem, ruby-debug-ide, that does not work with interpreters like JRuby, Rubinius, Ruby.NET, and IronRuby. Click Install Debugger to install this gem. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Ruby on Rails Projects.</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Show Logical Project View (Restart Required).</b> Toggle between a file view of Rails projects or a logical view in the Projects window, after restarting the IDE. The default view is logical. You can also see a file view of your projects by clicking the Files tab or choosing Window &gt; Files. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
