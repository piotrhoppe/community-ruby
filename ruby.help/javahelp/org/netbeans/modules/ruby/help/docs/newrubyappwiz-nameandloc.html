<h2>New Ruby Application Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 


<p>In this panel of the New Ruby Application wizard, you set the name of the project and can change its default location. You can also decide not to make it the main project, and you can choose to either not create a main file or to create one with a default name or a name you choose. When you're done, since  this is the last panel, you click Finish to create the project. </p>
<p><i>You get to this panel by choosing File &gt; New Project, and, in the New Project wizard, selecting the category Ruby and the project type Ruby Application.</i></p>
<p>The panel displays the following configuration options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the  name of the project, which is displayed in the Projects window. This name is also used to create the project folder and the context path.</li>
<li><b>Project Location.</b>  Specifies the location where you want to store the project metadata and source code.</li>
<li><b>Project Folder.</b>  Specifies the folder where you want to store the project metadata and source code. The folder is a concatenation of the project location and the project name.</li>
<li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> Sets the newly created project as the main project in the Projects window.</li>
<li><b>Create Main File.</b> Indicates whether or not to create a main file for the Ruby application. You can change default name of this file from <code>main.rb</code>.</li>
<li><b>Ruby Interpreter: <i>interpreter-name</i>.</b> If you want to use an interpreter other than the one indicated, click Change, then click OK in the message window that lets you know that changing the interpreter affects the entire IDE. The <a href="rubyoptions.html">Options window</a> opens with the Ruby options selected. If necessary, select the Platform tab, then click the Browse button next to the Ruby Interpreter field, navigate to the interpreter file in your Ruby or Rails installation, and click the Open button.
  <ul class="note">
      <li>If you are switching back to the JRuby interpreter, the path to the interpreter file is<br> 
      <code><i>netbeans-install-dir</i>/ruby1/jruby-<i>version-number</i>/bin/jruby.bat</code>, where <i>version-number</i> is the version of ruby installed by the IDE, such as 1.0.2.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
