<h2>Rails Plugins Manager</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 


<p>The Rails Plugins  manager enables you to add and maintain Ruby on Rails plugins, which are third-party Rails libraries. To open the Rails Plugin manager choose Tools > Rails Plugin from the main menu. </p>
<p>The manager has the following tabs.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Installed tab.</b> Click this tab  to view a list of the plugins  that have been installed for the registered Ruby on Rails platform. You can update a single plugin to its latest version by selecting it and clicking Update, or you can update all plugins by clicking the one of the Update buttons. To remove an installed plugin, select it and click the Uninstall button. </li>
  <li><b>New Plugins tab.</b> Click this tab to see the plugins you can add to your Ruby platform. To add a new plugin, select it and click the Install button, and then click OK in the <a href="geminstallsettingsdialog.html">Plugin Installation Settings dialog box</a> to install it. Typically you leave the settings unchanged in this dialog box.</li>
  <li><b>Repositories tab.</b> This tab shows where the IDE looks for Rails plugins. You can add a repository either by clicking Find New or by manually entering a repository URL after clicking Add URL. To remove a repository, select it and click Unregister.</li>
  <li><b>Settings tab.</b> When you open the dialog box, you might see the message, "Nothing found: Network problem? Check NetBeans proxy settings." To set your proxy, click this tab and then click the Configure Proxies button. You might need to set  your proxy server if you are behind a firewall. By default, NetBeans uses your system proxy settings.</li>
