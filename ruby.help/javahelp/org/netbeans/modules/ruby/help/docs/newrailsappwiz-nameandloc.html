<h2>New Ruby on Rails Application Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 


<p>In this panel of the New Ruby on Rails Application wizard, you set the name of the project and can change its default location. You can also  make choices concerning the database to use and whether or not to use Rake. </p>
<p><i>You get to this panel by choosing File &gt; New Project, and, in the New Project wizard, selecting the category Ruby and the project type Ruby on Rails Application.</i></p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>Clicking the Next button will take you to the next panel, which enables you to install or update Rails and to install OpenSSL support. Clicking the Finish button creates the project without these options. </li>
</ul>
<p>The panel displays the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the  name of the project, which is displayed in the Projects window. This name is also used to create the project folder and the context path.</li>
<li><b>Project Location.</b>  Specifies the location where you want to store the project metadata and source code.</li>
<li><b>Project Folder.</b>  Specifies the folder where you want to store the project metadata and source code. The folder is a concatenation of the project location and the project name.</li>
<li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> Sets the newly created project as the main project in the Projects window.</li>
<li><b>Database.</b> Specifies the database you will use with the project. If you want use a database other than one of those on the list, choose Other. When the project starts up, your <code>database.yml</code> file  automatically opens so you can edit it.
  
</li>
<li> <b>If Using JRuby.</b> The following two options are useful only if you are using JRuby.
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Access Database Using JDBC.</b> Specifies that your application will use the ActiveRecord-JDBC gem, which
        enables your application to access
        database servers that provide JDBC 3.0 compliant drivers. 
<ul class="note">
    <li>You typically do not select this option if you are using MySQL, since NetBeans Ruby supplies an adapter for that database that works without JDBC.</li>
    <li>If you choose this option, you must copy the driver file for the database that you choose to the JRuby <code>lib</code> directory. The path to this directory is similar to <code><i>netbeans-install-dir</i>/ruby1/jruby-1.0/lib</code>. To find the location of your JRuby installation, choose Tools > Options from the main menu, click Miscellaneous, and click the Ruby icon.</li>

  <li> <b>Add Rake Targets to Support App Server Deployment (.war).</b> Choose this option if you want to create a <code>.war</code> file so you can deploy your application to an application server, such as  Glassfish.
