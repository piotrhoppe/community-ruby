<h2>Choose Ruby Interpreter Dialog Box</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> 


<p>This dialog box enables you to select a  Ruby interpreter that is different from the default JRuby interpreter if you have your own Ruby or Rails software installed. If the path to your installed Ruby interpreter is in your  PATH system variable, this dialog box opens the first time a Ruby interpreter is needed, such as when you first create a Ruby project or a Ruby on Rails project in the IDE.
<ul>
  <li>If you want to use JRuby, either leave it selected on the list and click OK or just click Cancel.</li>
  <li>If you prefer to use an installed native Ruby interpreter that is on the list,  select it from the list and click OK.
<ul class="note">
  <li>If you change the interpreter, you also change the Ruby platform used by the IDE. Only the gems loaded by your Ruby platform are used by the IDE, and any changes you make to gems while your interpreter is active affect only this platform.
  </li>
  </ul>  

</li>
  <li>If you want to use a Ruby interpreter that isn't on the list, click Other. The Options window opens with the Ruby Platform tab selected. Click the Browse button next to the Ruby Interpreter field and navigate to the interpreter file in your Ruby or Rails installation, then click the Open button. </li>
</ul>
