<h1> resolv library</h1>
resolv.rb is a resolver library written in Ruby. Since it is written in Ruby, it is thread-aware. I.e. it can resolv many hostnames concurrently. <br><br>It is possible to lookup various resources of DNS using DNS module directly. <br><h2> example</h2>
<pre style="color:#000000;">
  p Resolv.getaddress("www.ruby-lang.org")
  p Resolv.getname("210.251.121.214")
</pre>
<pre style="color:#000000;">
  Resolv::DNS.open {|dns|
    p dns.getresources("www.ruby-lang.org", Resolv::DNS::Resource::IN::A).collect {|r| r.address}
    p dns.getresources("ruby-lang.org", Resolv::DNS::Resource::IN::MX).collect {|r| [r.exchange.to_s, r.preference]}
  }
</pre>
<h2> Resolv class</h2>
<h3> class methods</h3>
&#8212; Resolv.getaddress(name) &#8212; Resolv.getaddresses(name) &#8212; Resolv.each_address(name) {|address| ...} <pre style="color:#000000;">
    They lookups IP addresses of ((|name|)) which represents a hostname
    as a string by default resolver.
</pre>
<pre style="color:#000000;">
    getaddress returns first entry of lookupped addresses.
    getaddresses returns lookupped addresses as an array.
    each_address iterates over lookupped addresses.
</pre>

    lookups hostnames of ((|address|)) which represents IP address as a string.
</pre>
<pre style="color:#000000;">
    getname returns first entry of lookupped names.

  _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target
</pre>
The fields specific to SRV are defined in RFC 2782 as meaning: <ul>
<li><tt>priority</tt> The priority of this target host.  A client MUST attempt   to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority it can   reach; target hosts with the same priority SHOULD be tried in an   order defined by the weight field.  The range is 0-65535.  Note that   it is not widely implemented and should be set to zero. </ul>
<ul>
<li><tt>weight</tt> A server selection mechanism.  The weight field specifies   a relative weight for entries with the same priority. Larger weights   SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability of being   selected. The range of this number is 0-65535.  Domain administrators   SHOULD use Weight 0 when there isn't any server selection to do, to   make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). Note that it is   not widely implemented and should be set to zero. </ul>
<ul>
<li><tt>port</tt>  The port on this target host of this service.  The range is 0-   65535. </ul>
<ul>
<li><tt>target</tt> The domain name of the target host. A target of "." means   that the service is decidedly not available at this domain. </ul>
