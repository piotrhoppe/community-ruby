    Subject:  Addressing Needs

    <%= to[/\w+/] %>:

    Just wanted to send a quick note assuring that your needs are being
    addressed.

    I want you to know that my team will keep working on the issues,
    especially:

    <%# ignore numerous minor requests -- focus on priorities %>
    % priorities.each do |priority|
      
      * <%= priority %>
    % end

    Thanks for your patience.

Some other cases to check:

  Lines containing % should not be treated as Ruby
  %% lines_with_two_percents :should, :be, :considered, :ruby
  <%% double_percents_should_be_cancelled %%>
  <% normal %>
  <%= normalexpr %>
  <%# comment %>
  html
  <div></div>
.e.o.f.
