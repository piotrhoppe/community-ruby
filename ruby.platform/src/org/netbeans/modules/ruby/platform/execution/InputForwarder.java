/**
 * <p>An InputForwarder takes user input in for example a Program I/O window,
 * and sends it to a child process. In other words it "redirects" or forwards
 * the input to the child process. This class doesn't actually care if the I/O
 * is in a child process - it just forwards data to a given output stream.
 * <p>
 * Great care is taken to make this forwarding interruptible, such that it
 * won't block if process execution is terminated or interrupted. To do this,
 * it's generally going to sleep for short intervals when there is no available
 * I/O rather than calling a blocking I/O operation.
